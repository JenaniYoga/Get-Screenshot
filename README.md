# Get Screenshot.py
This Python script captures a screenshot using the `pyscreenshot` library and saves it as `Sample_Screenshot.png`.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install pyscreenshot
## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies.
3. Run the `Get Screenshot.py` script.
4. After a 5-second delay, the script captures the screenshot.
5. The screenshot is saved as `Sample_Screenshot.png` in the same directory as the script.
6. The screenshot is also displayed.

## Notes
- Adjust the delay time as needed by modifying the `time.sleep()` function parameter.
- You can customize the filename and file format by changing the parameters in the `k.save()` function.
- The script uses the `k.show()` function to display the captured screenshot. You may remove or comment out this line if you don't want to display the screenshot.

Feel free to modify and integrate this script into your projects!
